# FT_CONTAINERS
ft_containers is a project from the 42 school common core curriculum that aims at making us learn about C++ generic programming and data structures (Binary Search Trees and AVL) by re-implementing some of the standard library data structures such as `vector`, `stack` and `map`.

# TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS LEARNED
* Sequence containers (vector).
* Data structures and algorithms: implementation of a balanced tree (AVL) for map.
* Associative containers (map).
* Container Adapters (stack).
* Iterators / constant iterators.
* C++ generic programming (templates).
